    <h3>Q) which part of the interview suprised
      you the most?</h3>

    <p>
      I expected the interview to be harder
      than
      anticipated but to my suprise the VIIT team
      that took my interview was pretty chill and
      friendly which took me by a suprise as I was
      worried they might be too harsh on me and
      that would make me
      nervous and lead to a bad interview, but to
      my suprise it was an amazing interview and I
      had a lot of fun in it.

    <h3>Q) what was the most memorable moment of
      your interview?</h3>

    <p>to be honest i dont remeber most of what
      happened in that interview cause I was too
      nervous to even think properly but the most
      memorable moment would be when i got to show
      my basic website but they still
      appreciated it and were very encouraging.
      they even helped me make it even better that
      made my day as wasnt that confident on that
      website and didnt share it with anyone cause
      of it.</p>

    <h3>Q) which interview moment are you proud of?
    </h3>
    <p>I wasnt proud of anything in particular
      but i was happy that i didnt bore any of the
      jnterviewers cause my interview was the last
      one and at that point most of the
      jnterviewers looked tierd which lead to
      think that it might go bad but in the end
      it wasnt bad at all and was one of the most
      fun interviews I've had. </p>

    <h3>Q) rate your interview on a scale of 1 to
      10.</h3>
    <p>my interview was a solid 10. the interview
      went on for more than an hour but it passed
      by so fast that i never realised and i was
      having a lot of fun talking to the
      interviewers and it had been a long time
      since I had talked to so many people. I was
      hella nervous at first but later on I got
      comfortable to speak freely.</p>

    <h3>Q) something in the interview the
      interviewer should have done differently?
    </h3>

    <p>
      There isnt anything in particular I wanted done differently cause
      I was pretty satisfied with how the interview went and how I had performed in it.
      the interviewers were really chill and fun to talk with and they made me feel like I
      wasnt talking to a senior but a friend which made me feel at ease.
